PHPUnit
======

The tests requires phpunit

Tests
=====

To run the tests:

	./tests.sh

To create new tests, add files to suites/ (see exists tests for examples),
and optionally edit phpunit.xml if you create a new suite

Blueprints
=======

To ease creation of tests there are a Blueprint-class for creating models.
Documentation on that is located in the blueprints-directory.
I recommend using Blueprints for your own projects BO-related tests too.
